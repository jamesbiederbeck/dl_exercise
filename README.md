# Deep Learning Exercise
Here you'll find a data science exercise that may be solved with deep learning techniques.  While you're encouraged to use deep learning, this problem can certainly be solved other ways.  Be sure to document your thought processes and justify *why* you used your solution.

## Limits
You shouldn't spend longer than 1-2 hours on this exercise.  You won't be timed so be sure to relax and choose a time that suits you.  It's perfectly acceptable if you don't complete the exercise.  Just be sure to document your progress and explain your strategies.  You're encouraged to use and cite prior research.

## The Problem
The goal of this exercise is to build a reliable heartbeat detector given electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
